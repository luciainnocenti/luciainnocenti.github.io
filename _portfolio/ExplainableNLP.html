In this project, we tackled the challenge of understanding and predicting customer sentiment in Amazon product reviews. We developed a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
pipeline that not only accurately classifies the sentiment of review sentences but also provides insights into the words and phrases that most influence the classification.

<h2>Main Points</h2>
<ul>
<li> <b>Sentiment Classification:</b> Leveraged a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with self-attention to classify review sentences into positive, negative, or neutral categories.</li>
<li> <b>Explainability Analysis:</b> Utilized the attention mechanism within the BiLSTM to identify the key terms that contribute most significantly to the sentiment prediction, enhancing transparency and interpretability.</li>
<li> <b>Robust NLP Pipeline:</b> Implemented a comprehensive NLP pipeline, including preprocessing steps like stop-word removal and tokenization, along with advanced techniques like BERT word embeddings.</li>
<li> <b>Performance Evaluation:</b> Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Highlights:</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>BERT Word Embeddings:</b> Utilized BERT to generate rich contextual word representations, capturing nuanced meanings and relationships between words.</li>
<li><b>BiLSTM with Self-Attention:</b> Employed a BiLSTM architecture to process the sequential nature of text data, while self-attention enabled the model to focus on the most relevant parts of each sentence.</li>
<li><b>Custom LSTM Cell:</b> Implemented a customized LSTM cell to fine-tune the model's behavior and improve performance.</li>
<li><b>Explainability through Attention:</b> Extracted attention values to quantify the importance of each word in the sentiment classification process, providing valuable insights into the model's decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes:</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Accurate Sentiment Prediction:</b>  Achieved an accuracy and recall of approximately 67% on the test set, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in classifying review sentiment.</li>
<li><b>Interpretable Results: </b> The explainability analysis provided clear explanations for the model's predictions, highlighting the key words and phrases that influenced the sentiment classification.</li>
<li><b>Potential for Further Development: </b> Identified potential areas for improvement, such as addressing dataset imbalance and exploring alternative model architectures, to further enhance the model's performance and interoperability.</li>
</ul>
