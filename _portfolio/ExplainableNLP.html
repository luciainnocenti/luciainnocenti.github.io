In this project, we tackled the challenge of understanding and predicting customer sentiment in Amazon product reviews. We developed a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
pipeline that not only accurately classifies the sentiment of review sentences but also provides insights into the words and phrases that most influence the classification.

# Main Points
- **Sentiment Classification:** Leveraged a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with self-attention to classify review sentences into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- **Explainability Analysis:** Utilized the attention mechanism within the BiLSTM to identify the key terms that contribute most significantly to the sentiment prediction, enhancing transparency and interpretability.
- **Robust NLP Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive NLP pipeline, including preprocessing steps like stop-word removal and tokenization, along with advanced techniques like BERT word embeddings.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks.

# Technical requirements

Technical Highlights:

- **BERT Word Embeddings:** Utilized BERT to generate rich contextual word representations, capturing nuanced meanings and relationships between words.
- **BiLSTM with Self-Attention:** Employed a BiLSTM architecture to process the sequential nature of text data, while self-attention enabled the model to focus on the most relevant parts of each sentence.
- **Custom LSTM Cell:** Implemented a customized LSTM cell to fine-tune the model's behavior and improve performance.
- **Explainability through Attention:** Extracted attention values to quantify the importance of each word in the sentiment classification process, providing valuable insights into the model's decision-making.
