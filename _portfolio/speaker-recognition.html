This project is about the analysis of different audio files in order to compute the "speaker recognition task", that is about reading the file and select who's speaking from a set of possible choices.
For the analysis, I have used Librosa, that is a Python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.

The files were produced by different audio-books and they were highly noised. So the data cleaning and noise reduction phases were foundamental in order to obtai good results.
Then, different classification algorithms were been applied in order to compare results
