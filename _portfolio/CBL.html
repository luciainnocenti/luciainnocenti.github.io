This project aimed at investigating how hospitals can collaborate to build better AI models without sharing sensitive patient data.
We compared traditional methods (Federated Learning - FL) with a newer, potentially more efficient approach (Consensus-Based Learning - CBL) on a wide range of collaborative medical data analysis scenarios. 
Our findings showed that CBL can be just as accurate than FL, but with significant savings in time and computing power, making AI development more accessible for smaller institutions. 
This study opens a novel perspective on the deployment of collaborative AI in real-world applications, whereas the adoption of cost-effective methods is instrumental to achieve sustainability 
and democratisation of AI by alleviating the need for extensive computational resources.
