#HI, I'M LUCIA!
Always passionate about technology and the future, I graduated in computer engineering and I am pursuing the MSc in Data Science at @PoliTo. 
In parallel with my studies, I always look for new experiences that allow me to complete my profile and that excite me. As Data Science student, I'm facing both Classic Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms, and I've also attended courses about Optimization, Decision Making processes, Network Dynamics and Big Data, experiencing Spark and Hadoop.
